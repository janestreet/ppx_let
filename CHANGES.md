## Release v0.16.0

* Exposed more internals to allow other ppxes to build similar extensions of `let`.

## Old pre-v0.15 changelogs (very likely stale and incomplete)

## git version

- Support for `%map.A.B.C` syntax to use values from a specific module, rather
  than the one in scope.

## v0.11

- Depend on ppxlib instead of (now deprecated) ppx\_core and  ppx\_driver.

## 113.43.00

- Dropped `Open_in_body` support from ppx\_let, since it was only ever used
  in confusing chains of `Let_syntax` modules that introduced other
  `Let_syntax` modules in the "body" (e.g. for defining Commands whose
  bodies use Async).  In this case it was decided that the better
  practice is to be explicit with `open ___.Let_syntax` at the different
  transition points, even though this is more verbose.
